// Task 1. Calorie tracking app

// You are asked to design a calorie tracking app, which helps users to:

// Keep a record of their activities.
// Monitor the number of calories they lose when performing the activity.


let minutes = 30;           //30 minutes everyday
let days = 15;              //5 days
let calories = 225;         //225 calories for 30 mins

let totalCaloriesLost =  days * calories;
console.log(totalCaloriesLost);
